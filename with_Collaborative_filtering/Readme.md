In this program, it can predict the itemâ€™s ratings which is not yet rated. I used collaborative filtering method and cosine similarity measure. First, this program make rating dictionary and according to this dictionary, find the rating value of test item set.
There are two main functions in this program. First, distance measure algorithm. I employ cosine similarity measure because it is recommended in recommender system and indeed it leads to better results than others measurement. The other function is predict rating function which is using collaborative filtering based algorithm and user based algorithm. This function is really important because it reflects all result and evaluation. It evaluate the average ratings of neighbors.
This program result RMSE is almost 9 in average of five test data.
